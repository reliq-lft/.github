# ReliQ lattice field theory ecosystem
> "Great things are done by a series of small things brought together." - Vincent Van Gogh

`ReliQ` is an experimental lattice field theory ecosystem targeting user-friendliness, performance, reliability, and portability across current and future heterogeneous architectures. We want the process of writing practical and performant lattice field theory programs in `ReliQ` to be both enjoyable, productive, and rewarding. As such, the `ReliQ` ecosystem shall revolve around the [ReliQ framework](https://github.com/reliq-lft/ReliQ), which will provide the baseline parallel primitives, both for more focused components of the `ReliQ` ecosystem and any applications/code-bases that may reside outside of it. 

> Please note that `ReliQ` is in the early development stage; it is not production-ready at this point. 

To say that we stand on the shoulders of giants is an understatement. As such, we'd like to acknowledge that the decisions going into designing `ReliQ` are heavily influenced by the [Quantum EXpressions (QEX)](https://github.com/jcosborn/qex) and [Grid](https://github.com/paboyle/Grid) lattice field theory frameworks. Namely, we would like to see `ReliQ` reflect the unyielding beauty and simplicity of `QEX` and the scalability, reliability, and portability of the powerhouse that is `Grid`. Our evolving approach to documentating `ReliQ` is heavily influenced by Peter Lepage's suite of lattice field theory analysis libraries; namely, [gvar](https://github.com/gplepage/gvar) and [lsqfit](https://github.com/gplepage/lsqfit), both of which demonstrate that good documentation must strive to teach the user how to use the tools that it provides while also teaching the user a little bit about the topic at hand (whether or not they realized it). We encourage everybody to explore these code bases, as we think that there is a lot to be learned from their insistence on providing a quality product that is open and available to everyone.
